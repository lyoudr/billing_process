The GNU 'hello' program (<https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/>) produces
a familiar, friendly greeting.  It allows nonprogrammers to use a
classic computer science tool which would otherwise be unavailable to
them.  Because it is protected by the GNU General Public License, users
are free (in perpetuity) to share and change it.

   Not to spoil the joke, but of course the practical purpose of GNU
Hello is to serve as a minimal example of a GNU package.  So, although
most manuals don't need to discuss the implementation of the programs
they document, that is part of the goal here.
